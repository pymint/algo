Trading algo that gets historical data from Oanda server using login and token for API, calculates a polynomial regression channel with different parameters for each instrument and opens a trade if the price has reached a certain number of standard deviations (custom paramater for each instrument). Closes the trade and opens another in opposite direction if the reverse condition is met.
